Text Browser-Based MMO is a project with with forum integration.

TBBM (Text Browser-Based MMO) is my personal bachelor's degree project which aims to integrate activity on forum, such as posting, liking, helping others etc., as a reward for possible energy (or some kind of resource) points in-game to promote community interaction, which can also be not related to the game itself.

Hopefully this way communities can be much more active and interactive, than just sticking to the topic they are about, expanding the possibilities and offering a lot of fun and reasons to socialize with other members.

#### Planned features:
1. Forum activity integration
2. NPCs, dialogue integration

#####What are those?
1. Forum activity integration - Every action that an user (or ALMOST every action) does on a forum, such as posting, creating a thread, upvoting etc., will reward him some **resource points** which are going to help advancing in the game. 
2. NPCs, dialogue integration - As every other MMO, TBBM plans to have some interaction, except that with the users, with NPCs, such as answering to dialogues or reading them.
