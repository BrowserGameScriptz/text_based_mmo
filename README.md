Text Based MMO is a project with forum integration.

TBM (Text Based MMO) is my personal bachelor's degree project which aims to integrate activity on forum, such as posting, liking, helping others etc., as a reward for possible energy (or some kind of resource) points in-game to promote community interaction, which can also be not related to the game itself.

Hopefully this way communities can be much more active and interactive, than just sticking to the topic they are about, expanding the possibilities and offering a lot of fun and reasons to socialize with other members.
